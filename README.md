# Zentry Clone - Frontend Showcase

This project is a clone of the stunning website **Zentry.com**, created to showcase my frontend development skills. The goal of this clone is to replicate the beautiful UI, animations, and interactive features of the original website, while demonstrating my expertise in modern frontend technologies like **ReactJS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **GSAP**.

## **Features**

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant animations and transitions that replicate the original design's interactivity, powered by **GSAP**.
- **ReactJS**: Built using ReactJS for component-based architecture and reactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with a utility-first approach.
- **Optimized Performance**: Focus on performance optimization to ensure a fast and smooth experience.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works well across all modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## **Tech Stack**

- **ReactJS**: For building reusable components and creating a dynamic, interactive UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the layout with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **GSAP**: Used for advanced animations and smooth transitions, replicating the effects from the original website.
- **Vite**: Used as the development build tool for faster performance and hot module reloading.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For logic and interactivity within the React components.
- **CSS Animations**: For additional animations and transitions when needed.

## **Challenges Faced**

Some of the challenges I encountered during development:

- **Replicating complex animations**: The original website features intricate animations. I used **GSAP** for smooth and advanced animations, integrating it with React to achieve the desired interactive effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the layout works perfectly across various screen sizes using **Tailwind's responsive utilities** and custom media queries.

## **Future Improvements**

Some features I plan to add or improve:

- **SEO Optimization**: Enhance the siteâ€™s SEO for better discoverability.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve accessibility by implementing ARIA roles, ensuring keyboard navigation, and adding better support for screen readers.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Perform additional testing for edge cases in older browsers.
